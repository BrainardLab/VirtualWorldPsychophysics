# Measurement of Lightness Discrimination Thresholds

Experiment to study human lightness discrimination thresholds 
under changes in spectral properties of objects and light 
sources. 

This project is a part of the VirtualWorldColorConstancy project. 
This repository contains the codebase to run the psychophysics 
experiments. 

To run one acquisition of the experiment the function 
required is runAcquisitioBySubjectName(). 

The main experimental function is: runLightnessExperiment().
